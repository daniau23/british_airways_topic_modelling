### **British Airways Customer Reviews**
This project takes you through the following;
    
    - Text analytics
    - Text preprocessing
    - Topic modelling with LDA
    - Dynamic Topic Modelling with LDA
    - Topic modelling and Dynamic Topic Modelling with BERTopic

Having conducted this experimentation, I believe the LDA approach is more suited for this project with the use of bigrams to capture the required topics for this corpus.

Feel free to replicate this project
