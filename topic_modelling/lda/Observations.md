### **LDA Observations**
- After careful examinations, both bigrams adn trigrams produce the same needed number of topics; four
- So one could just make use of bigrams rather than using trigrams.

### Dynamic Topic Modelling with LDA
- Using DTM with LDA, topic evolution over time was observed
- By modifying the chain_variance, the topics positions switched; topic 0 and topic 1.
